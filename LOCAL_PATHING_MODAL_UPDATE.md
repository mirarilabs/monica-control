# Local Pathing Toggle Moved to Song Modal

## Overview

The local pathing toggle has been moved from the main interface into the song selection modal for better organization and cleaner UI design.

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Reorganization
- **Removed**: Pathing toggle from main interface (cluttered the controls area)
- **Added**: Pathing toggle inside song selection modal under "‚öôÔ∏è Performance Options" section
- **Benefit**: Groups related functionality together (song selection + performance options)

### 2. Modal Structure
The song modal now has three sections:
1. **üìÄ Preloaded Songs** - Song selection list
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Performance Options** - Local pathing toggle (NEW)
3. **üìÅ Upload Custom Song** - Future upload functionality

### 3. Updated Styling
- **New CSS classes**: `.pathing-option-modal`, `.pathing-checkbox-modal`, `.pathing-info-modal`
- **Modal-specific styling**: Optimized for modal context with appropriate margins and spacing
- **Consistent design**: Matches existing modal styling patterns

### 4. JavaScript Updates
- **Element ID change**: `local-pathing` ‚Üí `local-pathing-modal`
- **Functionality preserved**: Same behavior, just different location
- **Modal integration**: Toggle state captured when starting performance

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Pathing toggle was always visible on main interface
- Took up space in controls area
- Less organized interface

### After
- Pathing toggle only appears when selecting songs
- Cleaner main interface
- Related options grouped together
- Better workflow: select song ‚Üí choose options ‚Üí start performance

## Technical Details

### HTML Changes
```html
<!-- Removed from main interface -->
<div class="pathing-option">...</div>

<!-- Added to modal -->
<div class="song-section">
    <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Performance Options</h3>
    <div class="pathing-option-modal">
        <label class="pathing-checkbox-modal">
            <input type="checkbox" id="local-pathing-modal" checked>
            Process song pathing locally (faster performance, selected by default)
        </label>
    </div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Changes
```javascript
// Updated element reference
const localPathing = document.getElementById('local-pathing-modal').checked;
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface**: Main controls area is less cluttered
2. **Better Organization**: Related options grouped together
3. **Improved Workflow**: Options appear when relevant (during song selection)
4. **Space Efficiency**: Modal space used more effectively
5. **User Focus**: Pathing option appears in context of song selection

## Backward Compatibility

- **Functionality**: Identical behavior to before
- **Default State**: Still checked by default (local pathing enabled)
- **API**: No changes to backend or API calls
- **User Settings**: Toggle state is not persisted (resets to default each session)

The local pathing toggle is now better integrated into the song selection workflow, making the interface cleaner and more intuitive to use.
